# Postlite - minimal blogging

## About

Postlite is a blogging engine, created with simplicity in mind. The goal was to give users a way to create and host static websites,
without diving too much into configuration specifics. Even though, other blogging engines like Jekyll and Hugo (or even Wordpress) give much
more possibilities, Postlite has more of a DIY approach. 

I firmly believe that the more possibilities lay ahead the harder it is to choose the 'correct one'. Instead of learning how the engine works,
users should focus on what really matters - building their website exactly how they want it. With nothing to interfere with their creative process.

## Setup

### Website structure

Your website needs to follow a certain structure:

```bash
mysite/
├── assets/       # all media (images etc.)
├── index.md      # landing page
├── posts/
├── public/       # auto generated by postlite
└── styles/
```

### Posts

Posts should be written in Markdown. The file name should be the current date when writing the post e.g. `25022025.md`

Each post starts with a Front Matter block, like so:

```
---
title: a post title
stylesheet: ../assets/styles/mystyles.css
---
```

Front Matter uses YAML format. Above, are the only supported fields (currently).

## Running

First, you need to generate the static content. You can do that using `generate` command:

```
postlite generate --root myblog/
```

Then, you can start the server with:

```
postlite serve --root myblog/ --port ":8080"
```
